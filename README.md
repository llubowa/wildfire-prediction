# wildfire-prediction
This repository contains my solution for Zindi's Wildfire Prediction Challenge, where I ranked 27th out of 82 and the best from Uganda. It includes data wrangling, feature engineering, and the development of machine learning models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and a Stacking Regressor ensemble to predict wildfire burn areas.
